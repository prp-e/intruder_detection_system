# Intruder activity detection 

## Environment variables

* `BOT_API` : you have to get it from _BotFather_ on Telegram.
* `CHAT_ID` : you have to find it out. One easy way is to run my [rubytestbot](https://github.com/prp-e/rubytestbot) project on your bot before doing anything.
* `SERVER_ADDRESS` : you must set `activities` folder as a root folder for your server. never forget to put `/` at the end of address.
